# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but is still _critical_ on your journey as a developer.

## Requirements

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Submit an updated resume

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile

## Instructions

1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
2. [GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](hhttps://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).

Your updated portfolio should contain the following:

1. Your full name

2. Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

3. A link to a PDF of your resume

4. A list of 3-5 projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Ensure that your portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes

#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile:

1. Professional profile picture

   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Your current location

4. Email address

5. Link to your portfolio

6. Pin 3-6 repositories that you want to highlight

   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

   * Click "Customize your pins"

   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

   * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

7. Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators

9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits
