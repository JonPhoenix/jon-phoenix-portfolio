# Jon Phoenix - Portfolio

Presenting my portfolio as a full-stack web developer. The application delivers an extended structure comprised by home, about, portfolio galleries, and contact pages, including functional links to social media and a downloadable resume in pdf file.

This portfolio contains a collection of web applications featuring JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs, MySQL, Sequelize and responsive UI design across viewports. Also features [**"Discover Serenity"**](https://calebkirkish.github.io/discover-serenity/) and [**Breakaway**](https://breakaway-vacay.herokuapp.com/), two robust web applications created in collaboration with [**MVC-5**](https://github.com/MVC-5) team of developers.

Each project offers a link to the deployed online version and a link to the github repository.
